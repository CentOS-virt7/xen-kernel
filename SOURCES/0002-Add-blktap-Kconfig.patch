+         The block tap driver is an alternative to the block back driver
+         and allows VM block requests to be redirected to userspace through
+         a device interface.  The tap allows user-space development of
+         high-performance block backends, where disk images may be implemented
+         as files, in memory, or on other hosts across the network.  This
+         driver can safely coexist with the existing blockback driver.
